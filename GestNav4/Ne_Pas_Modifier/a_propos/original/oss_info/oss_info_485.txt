satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as
a consequence you may not distribute the Program
at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy
both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program.
