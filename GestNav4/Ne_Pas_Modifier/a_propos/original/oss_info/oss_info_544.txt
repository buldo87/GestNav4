entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not
based on the Library with the Library (or with a
work based on the Library) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the
other work under the scope of this License.
